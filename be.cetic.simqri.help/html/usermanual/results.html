<h2 id="os">One Shot Simulation Results</h2>

<p>
Once the "One Shot" simulation is over, results are displayed in a new window. This window is structured in several tabs : 

<ul>
    <li><b>Trace (Events)</b> : Details each action of the simulation at a defined time unit</li>
    <li><b>Elements</b> : shows the final state of each property for every elements</li>
    <li><b>Queries</b> : shows queries results</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>
</p>
<h2 id="saveas">Save as (One Shot Simulation)</h2>

<p>
    You can also save your results in a text file with a click on the "Save as" button. The file extension is already set by the system. All you have to do is to specify the name and the location of the file.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2 id="mc">Monte-Carlo Simulation Results</h2>

<p>
Once the "Monte-Carlo" simulation is over, results are processed through a report template and then generated into files whose the extension was selected by the user before the beginning of the simulation.
These files are situated into the "Generated Reports" folder. The name of subfolders are composed by the date and time of its reports generation.<br/>
<b class="red">Warning : you may have to do a refresh of the SimQRi project to display the generated report ! (right-click on the name of the project in the workspace and select "refresh").</b>

<h2 id="report1">Monte-Carlo - Overall charts report template</h2>
<p>
    This report template consists in a global view of the risks impact on the elements of the model. It contains several global charts without any detailed results.<br/><br/>

    This kind of report contains 5 sections :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Risk Distribution</b>: a pie chart that represents the share of each kind of risk (quantity, quality, delay) calculated through the queries written by the user.
        <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/overall1.PNG"></img>
        </li>
        <li><b>System Risks Histograms</b>: histograms that represent the frequency of each system risk (determined by its corresponding system query) depending on their calculated mean value.
        <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/overall2.PNG"></img>
        </li>
        <li><b>Suppliers/Processes/Storages Overall Risks Histograms</b>: histograms that represent an overall of the frequency of each quantity/quality/delay risks that affect suppliers/processes/storages of the model, depending on their calculated mean value.
        <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/overall3.PNG"></img>
        </li>
        <li><b>Aggregated Overall Risks Histograms</b>: histograms that represent an overall aggregation of the frequency of all kinds of risks that affect suppliers, processes and storages of the model, depending on their calculated mean value.
        <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li><b>Place of occurrence of Quantity/Quality/Delay Risk</b>: pie charts that represent the share of each element concerned by this kind of risk
        <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/overall4.PNG"></img>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2 id="report2">Monte-Carlo - Detailed charts report template</h2>
<p>
    This report template consists in a detailed view of the risks impact on the elements of the model. It contains several global and detailed charts and detailed tables of the simulation results.<br/><br/>

    This kind of report contains 6 sections :
    <ul>
        <li><b>Risk Distribution</b>: a pie chart that represents the share of each kind of risk (quantity, quality, delay) calculated through the queries written by the user.
        <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li><b>System Risks Histograms</b>: histograms that represent the frequency of each system risk (determined by its corresponding system query) depending on their calculated mean value.
        <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li><b>Suppliers/Processes/Storages Risks Histograms</b>: histograms that represent the frequency of each quantity/quality/delay risks that affect a given supplier/process/storage of the model, depending on their calculated mean value
        <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/detailed1.PNG"></img>
        </li>
        <li><b>Place of occurrence of Quantity/Quality/Delay Risk</b>: pie charts that represent the share of each element concerned by this kind of risk
        <br/><br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Main information about elements</b>: table that contains detailed information about each element of the model. 
            <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/detailed2.PNG"></img>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Further information</b>: table that contains results of the queries written by the user.
            <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/results/mc/detailed3.PNG"></img>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Furthermore, SimQRi allows the user to use its own report templates created with the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/birt/">Eclipse BIRT</a> reporting tool ! For more information about this feature, please download and consult the PDF file that explains how to create your custom report template on the <a href="http://simqri.cetic.be">SimQRi tools webpage</a>.
