<h1>Reference for the query language</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of the query language is to define what you want to measure on a stochastic factory model.</p>
<p>Such model represent the behavior of a factory over time. Such factory might exhibit stochastic behavior, as defined in the factory modeling section.</p>
<p>The simulation has two possible modes: single short, where the factory model is run only once, and Monte-Carlo, where the factory model is run a large number of times, and statistics are collected over the different queries submitted to the engine.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the single shot mode, one gets a value for each of the defined query, these being evaluated at the end of the simulation trace</li>
<li>In the Monte-Carlo mode, one gets statistics over these queries, such as min, max, average, median, variance, as well as two-dimensional statistics over two queries. Such statistics are actually elaborated after the engine being run, and on the basis of the collected values of the queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The query language therefore does not include any stochastic operator.</p>
<p>The query language supports two basic types: arithmetic and Boolean. Arithmetic is taken as floating numbers with double precision.</p>
<p>The value of a query is evaluated at the end of a simulation trace. So queries such as &ldquo;<em>is this storage empty</em>&rdquo; will be evaluated at this time. However, queries involving temporal operators such as &ldquo;<em>average of some storage content over time</em>&rdquo; involves that the storage content is evaluated at each point in time of the history, and these values are averaged at the end of the simulation trace.</p>
<p>The semantics of all operator is therefore defined with respect to a position in time, and a trace. These are designated as &ldquo;t&rdquo; for the position in time and the trace is implicit, since we only consider a single trace for the query language (multiple trace only appear at the Monte-Carlo level). The simulation proceed with discrete event-based time model. Each position in time has an associated time value, which is an arithmetic value. As time is discrete, we assume the existence of a prev(t) operator that deliver the time value at the previous discrete position of t.</p>
<p>The query language I made of two parts: the probes ad the operators. Probes are specific functions that extract a property of a simulation item and operators are classical mathematical operators such as &ldquo;+&rdquo;, or &ldquo;average over time&rdquo; operators.</p>
<p>Queries, and their constituent general are of two types: either Boolean expressions, or arithmetic expressions depending on the type of value they output. Besides, some are operators that take other expressions as parameters. In the sequel, arithmetic expressions are denoted by the names a1,a2, and logical expressions are denoted by the names l1,l2.</p>
<h2 id="1.1">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referencing processes and storages</h2>
<p>In the queries, processes and storages are referenced by their names. If the name contains space, it is required to surround the name by double quotes &ldquo; without incorporating additional heading or trailing spaces.</p>
<p>Processes and storages have a dedicated &ldquo;cost&rdquo; attribute that defines their cost function. The cost function is meant to declare the cost of the storage or process since the beginning of the simulation. It is declared using the query language defined here, except that when declaring such cost function, no storage or process can be referenced, but the one related to the declared cost function. This process or storage is referenced through a dedicated keyword: &ldquo;this&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="1.2"><a name="_Toc430351012"></a>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probes on suppliers and processes</h2>
<p>The probes on processes are atomic operator that extract basic metrics from processes of the simulation model. Suppose that <em>p</em> is such a process, designated by its name.</p>
<p>t|= running(p)</p>
<p>Boolean expression</p>
<p>true if the process is running at time t, false otherwise. A process might not be running if it is blocked by lack of input material or output storage blocking the outputting of items at the output of the process. Conveyor belt processes do not block by lack of input item. In case p has multiple lines, this evaluates to true if at least one line is running</p>
<p><br /> t|= completedBatchCount(p)</p>
<p>arithmetic expression</p>
<p>the total number of batches performed by the process between the beginning of the trace, and time t. A splitting process sums up the batches delivered to each of its outputs. For a process with multiple lines, it sums up the completed batches of each line.</p>
<p>t|= completedBatchCount(p,portNumber)</p>
<p>arithmetic expression</p>
<p>the total number of batches performed by the process between the beginning of the trace, and time t that have been output through port portNumber. For a process with multiple lines, it sums up the completed batches of each line. This only applies to SplittingBatch and SplittingSingleBatch processes.</p>
<p>t|= startedBatchCount(p)</p>
<p>arithmetic expression</p>
<p>the number of batches started by the process since the beginning of the trace<br /> for a process with multiple lines, it sums up the started batches of each line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>t|= totalWaitDuration(p)</p>
<p>arithmetic expression</p>
<p>The total duration where the process was not running between the beginning of the trace, and time t. for a process with multiple lines, it sums up the waiting time of each line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>t|= anyBatchStarted(p)</p>
<p>Boolean expression</p>
<p>true if a batch as started by the process at time t</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>t|= relativeStockLevel(s)</p>
<p>arithmetic expression</p>
<p>The relative content of storage s at time t, that is: the content of the stock divided by the capacity of the storage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>t|= totalPut(s)</p>
<p>arithmetic expression</p>
<p>The number of items that have been put in the storage s between the beginning of the simulation and time t, not counting the initial ones</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="1.4">1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracing queries: the higher order query &ldquo;record&rdquo;</h2>
<p>To obtain the trace of the evolution of the value for a query over the simulation, one can use the special, higher order query <em>record</em>. The syntax for such query is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>record(q)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where <em>q</em> is a valid query (excepting another record query). The result of <em>record(q)</em> is a list of tuples [(t1,v1), &hellip;, (tn,vn)], where, for 1 &pound; i &pound; n,&nbsp; ti is a timestamp belonging to the simulation interval, and vi is the value of q at that timestamp, i.e.:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ti ⊨ q evaluates to vi, for all i, 1 &pound; i &pound; n</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simulation engine records only the changes of values of <em>q</em> starting from the value at the beginning of simulation. This implies that for all i, v(i-1) &sup1; vi and vi &sup1; v(i+1).</p>
